Hi! I’m **Xiping Sun**, an M.S.E. Robotics student in the **GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania**. I am currently advised by Prof. Nadia. My research interest lies in touch sensing and human and robot interaction.

I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciencein May 2025. I was coadvised by [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/yuanwz){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and Prof. Craig Shultz, working at Robotouch Lab and Interactive Display Lab.
