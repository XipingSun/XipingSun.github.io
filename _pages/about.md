Hi! I’m **Xiping Sun**, an M.S.E. Robotics student in the **GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania**. 

I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) with a B.S. in Computer Science in May 2025. I was coadvised by [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/yuanwz){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Prof. Craig Shultz](https://www.craig-shultz.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, working at [Robotouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Interactive Display Lab](https://www.interactivedisplaylab.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
